Rules:

The classic "SNAKE" game. The rules are simple--
don't run into the wall, and don't run into your
own tail. It may seem easy at first, but just
wait, your snake will grow in length and speed
up as it eats!

Control your snake with the W, A, S, and D keys,
by simply pressing the key corresponding to the
direction you'd like your snake to turn. The goal
of the game is to get as high a score as possible
by eating as much food as you can. The amount by
which your score increases when your snake eats a
piece of food will increase with the difficulty of
the game. But be careful, as the game goes on,
preventing your snake from getting tangled up in
its own tail will take careful planning.

As a courtesy to more skilled players, the option
is provided to start with a longer and faster
snake. This will mean that the difficulty and the
rate at which points are accumulated will start
at a higher level.

Have fun playing!
