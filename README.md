README

This is a simple set of python scripts to run a version of the classic game SNAKE in the terminal. It relies on a few different Python 2 modules, most importantly "blessings" which allows the Python programmer to easily print characters of various colors and styles anywhere he/she wants in the terminal window.

Enjoy!
